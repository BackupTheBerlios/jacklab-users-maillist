Hi 

I'm using SUSE 9.3, and apt, to try to install the oc2pus versions of phat and 
specimen.  Both of them ask for libpangocairo.so, even though I have both 
cairo and pango installed.  Does anyone know where this file can be found?

Not running SuSE myself, but a quick search for "libpangocairo-1.0.so.0"
gives: SuSE 9.X
ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/supplementary/GNOME/update_for_9.3/base/pango-1.10.0-3.i586.rpm

a search for "libpangocairo-1.0.so" gives pango-devel from the update
repo. so maybe you might have to add the gnome repo to apt's
sources.list. 

try if this fixes it plz!

regards!

Hmm.  Trying to install pango-1.10 says that libcairo.so.2 is required, and 
there's no updated cairo package in supplementary, and even if it were, that 
will presumably require other updates.  Having read this:
http://forums.suselinuxsupport.de/lofiversion/index.php/t18115.html
I'm getting cold feet!

Thanks for the advice anyway.  I'll probably just wait for another 6 months 
(and openSUSE 10?) before I try some of these enticing audio apps.

Humm damn. Just heard that the gnome repositories have heavy
inconsistencies... that's why the dependencies are borked.
and if you want an app that uses gnome crap, you might run in trouble.
not a fault of jacklab or oc2pus though...

No idea about that, sorry. 

any other guys here? our SuSE users? :)

greets!
tom

No, indeed.  I wouldn't disagree with calling GNOME crap, though!

Yes thats a real heavy prob and i am suffering about this, too. Please 
write an email to oc2pus at arcor.de - maybe he can help you with a kind of 
workaround.

Hopefully this will never happen with oS10  ;) I allready work with it 
and it seemed to be pretty good.

Michael

Hi Michael - I'll do that.

That's interesting to know.  By the way, I really like the idea of jacklab - I 
just found it today.

Subject: [Jacklab-users] Libcairo problems with SUSE 9.3
Message-ID: <200509152039.00736.kevin@dotmon.com>

(This deals with the issue I posted about yesterday - if you like it could be 
put on the website as a howto.)

A recent version of cairo (cairo-1.0.0) contained only libcairo.so.2.  Many of 
the SUSE 9.3 rpms were compiled against an earlier version (cairo-0.3.0) 
which contained only libcairo.so.1.  Many recent rpms have been compiled 
against the new version, and will not install, because they have a dependency 
on libcairo.so.2 which cannot be met.  But upgrading cairo (or installing it 
from apt) will mean that existing apps will stop working unless you symlink 
libcairo.so.1 to the new libcairo.so.2.  This note (based on advice from 
oc2pus - thanks!) explains how to deal with this situation.

Run:
rpm -ql cairo
to see what version you have.  If it contains libcairo.so.1, you can either 
keep a copy of this:
(su) cd /usr/lib
(su) cp libcairo.so.1 libcairo.so.1_orig
and move it back once you have upgraded cairo, or you can make a symlink as 
shown below.  If it contains libcairo.so.2, carry out the last two steps here 
(symlink and virtual rpm).

Download cairo-1.0.0 from somewhere like:
ftp://ftp.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.suse.com/i386/supplementary/GNOME/update_for_9.3/applications
Cairo depends on libpixman, so you will need to install that if it is not 
already installed - the best thing is probably to download libpixman-0.1.6 
from the same place.  Many multimedia apps will also want libpangocairo.so.1, 
so get pango-1.10.0 while you're at it.  Download the equivalent -devel rpms 
from:
ftp://ftp.mirror.ac.uk/sites/ftp.suse.com/i386/supplementary/GNOME/update_for_9.3/development
if you think you might be compiling software later.

Go to the download directory, and run:
(su) rpm -Uvh libpix*
(su) rpm -Uvh cairo*
(su) rpm -Uvh pango*
(su) SuSEconfig

With the new cairo installed (or if "rpm -ql cairo" earlier showed 
libcairo.so.2), symlink libcairo.so.1:
(su) cd /usr/lib
(su) ln -s libcairo.so.2 libcairo.so.1

To keep the rpm database happy, so that it does not complain about a missing 
libcairo.so.1, install the attached myVirtualPackages.rpm (kindly supplied by 
oc2pus - see his script for this at:
http://www.linux-club.de/viewtopic.php?t=13336

The above steps mean that most of the multimedia rpms made by oc2pus at:
http://ftp4.gwdg.de/pub/linux/suse/apt/SuSE/9.2-i386/RPMS.suser-oc2pus/
should now install with no problems.

Hi Kevin!

Very cool, man! :)
Indeed a link to this mail in the archive should be posted as a hint!
Would be a harm if problems like that keep users off trying to use
linux as "soundmachine"!

Have fun testing audio stuff on linux ;)

Greets!
